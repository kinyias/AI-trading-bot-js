  Analyze the current market data for Internet Computer (ICP) using Smart Money Concept (SMC) to identify potential buy/sell opportunities. Ensure each trade has a stop-loss of 1.5% below the entry price and a take-profit of 3% above. Avoid trading during periods of extreme volatility (e.g., when Bollinger Bands widen significantly). Provide the signal in the following structured format for easy readability on Telegram:
  
ðŸ”¹ Signal Type: [ðŸŸ¢Buy/ðŸ”´Sell/Hold]  
ðŸ”¹ Entry Price: [Price]  
ðŸ”¹ Stop-Loss: [Price]  
ðŸ”¹ Take-Profit: [Price]  
ðŸ”¹ Confidence Level: [Low/Medium/High]  

ðŸ“Œ **Additional Notes:**  
- [Market sentiment, upcoming events, or key SMC levels].  
Focus on the most recent and high-confidence opportunity based on SMC principles (e.g., liquidity zones, order blocks, breaker blocks, or fair value gaps). Avoid overloading with multiple signalsâ€”provide only one clear and actionable signal.
If no valid or high-confidence opportunity is found, or if market conditions are unsuitable (e.g., extreme volatility, unclear SMC levels), respond with:
ðŸ”¹ Signal Type: No Signal  
ðŸ”¹ Reason: [Brief explanation, e.g., "Market conditions are unclear" or "No high-confidence SMC levels detected"].
